Arbitrum block time 0.25s

Optimistic Rollups: Simpler
You can prove one way, you can prove another way (correctness).
Question is, what does it cost to prove? Can a regular user with regular machine participate?
Optimistc Rollups a regular use can participate.
This is not true for zk

Upgrades:

BOLD Next gen proving tech, still optimistic. Makes proving fully permissionless. On testnet debated by DOA
Stylus: A multi-VM allowing smart contracts to run in any language. Execution of code is more effecient. Can do more with same Gas
Composable: Contracts in diff languages can interact
TimeBoost: Capture the value of MEV happening on their chains. Instead of that value captured by MEV searchers who are outside the system, it can be captured by the chain

Sequencer creates blocks

Just an intro video but I figured I'd send you the notes I make.

E-notaries. Replace lawyers in this fashion.
Services already exist for this but aren't legally binding yet.

Sensors/Robots can use it to write data.
Not sure this was a great example.

Chain of custody: Prove who owned what and when
Examples:

-   Track food supplies. Where did it come from, when was is made/sold/distributed.
-   Food has to be recalled. Instantly everyone knows who bought the foods

and where they went.
IBM and Walmost doing this right now.

Smart contracts:

Similar to a contract that we all know of but this one exists on the
blockchain. The result of this contract is verified by consensus.

Only allow funds to be released only when the predetermined parties approve.
Say two people want to start a company and put money in the corporate
account. One of them can't take everything.

Put coins into a smart contract and it gives you "tokens". Tokens can be
anything such as shares of a company.

Crowdfunding platforms can use smart contracts as a mechanism to prevent
the product team from getting any of the publics money until certain
milestones are met. Get rid of platforms like kickstarter.

Online shoppers can pay into a smart contract. The money is only
released when the package is received.

Distributed, transparent spotify where listeners can see their money
going to the artists they listen to.
